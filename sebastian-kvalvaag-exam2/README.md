Sebastian Kvalv√•g Exam-2 project Social Hub

# Social Hub

Is a social platform where you sign up
and start posting you can follow other people, comment or react to their posts. This is a school project and not intended for commercial use. Hope you enjoy!

## Description

As states above socialHub is a school project. My aim was to show that i am capable of making a fully working front end app for a social network. On this project i decided to put a little more time into coding and not focus as much on design and, i think it payed of. The app seems intuative from my limited user data, the design seemed boring to me at first but the more i used it the more i appreciated the simplicity.

-uses intersection observer for lazy loads
-there are three different routers in the project, the logged out router the logged in router and the third is the second nav witch uses a menu context to determine which menu to display when the overlay opens

-had to disable lint a couple of places search "//lint-disable-line" to find them
